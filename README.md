# Nostr Wallet Connect

This application allows you to control your Lightning node or wallet over Nostr.
Connect applications like [Damus](https://damus.io/) or [Amethyst](https://linktr.ee/amethyst.social) to your node.

**Specification**: [NIP-47](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/47.md)

## Supported Backends

- LND (see: lnd.go)
- Breez (see: breez.go)
- want more? please open an issue.

## Installation

### Requirements

The application has no runtime dependencies. (simple Go executable).

As data storage SQLite is used.

    $ cp .env.example .env
    # edit the config for your needs
    vim .env

To get a new random Nostr key use `openssl rand -hex 32` or similar.

## Development

### Server (HTTP mode)

1. Create a Lightning Polar setup with two LND nodes and uncomment the Polar LND section in your `.env` file.

2. Compile the frontend or run `touch frontend/dist/tmp` to ensure there are embeddable files available.

3. `go run .`

### React Frontend (HTTP mode)

Go to `/frontend`

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn dev`

### Wails (Backend + Frontend)

_Make sure to have [wails](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation) installed and all platform-specific dependencies installed (see wails doctor)_

`unset GTK_PATH && wails dev -tags "wails"`

_If you get a blank screen the first load, close the window and start the app again_

#### Wails Production build

`wails build -tags "wails"`

### Build and run locally (HTTP mode)

`mkdir tmp`
`go build -o main`
`cp main tmp`
`cp .env tmp`
`cd tmp`
`./main`

### Run dockerfile locally (HTTP mode)

`docker build . -t nwc-local`

`docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 nwc-local`

### Testing

`go test`

## Configuration parameters

- `NOSTR_PRIVKEY`: the private key of this service. Should be a securely randomly generated 32 byte hex string.
- `CLIENT_NOSTR_PUBKEY`: if set, this service will only listen to events authored by this public key. You can set this to your own nostr public key.
- `RELAY`: default: "wss://relay.getalby.com/v1"
- `PUBLIC_RELAY`: optional relay URL to be used in connection strings if `RELAY` is an internal URL
- `COOKIE_SECRET`: a randomly generated secret string.
- `DATABASE_URI`: a sqlite filename. Default: nwc.db (sqlite)
- `PORT`: the port on which the app should listen on (default: 8080)
- `LN_BACKEND_TYPE`: LND or BREEZ

### LND Backend parameters

_For cert and macaroon, either hex or file options can be used._

- `LND_ADDRESS`: the LND gRPC address, eg. `localhost:10009` (used with the LND backend)
- `LND_CERT_FILE`: the location where LND's `tls.cert` file can be found (used with the LND backend)
- `LND_CERT_HEX`: LND's hex-encoded `tls.cert` (used with the LND backend)
- `LND_MACAROON_FILE`: the location where LND's `admin.macaroon` file can be found (used with the LND backend)
- `LND_MACAROON_HEX`: LND's hex-encoded `admin.macaroon` (used with the LND backend)

### BREEZ Backend parameters

- `BREEZ_MNEMONIC`: your bip39 mnemonic key phrase e.g. "define limit soccer guilt trim mechanic beyond outside best give south shine"
- `BREEZ_API_KEY`: contact breez for more info
- `GREENLIGHT_INVITE_CODE`: contact blockstream for more info

## Application deeplink options

### `/apps/new` deeplink options

Clients can use a deeplink to allow the user to add a new connection. Depending on the client this URL has different query options:

#### NWC created secret

The default option is that the NWC app creates a secret and the user uses the nostr wallet connect URL string to enable the client application.

##### Query parameter options

- `name`: the name of the client app

Example:

`/apps/new?name=myapp`

#### Client created secret

If the client creates the secret the client only needs to share the public key of that secret for authorization. The user authorized that pubkey and no sensitivate data needs to be shared.

##### Query parameter options for /new

- `name`: the name of the client app
- `pubkey`: the public key of the client's secret for the user to authorize
- `return_to`: (optional) if a `return_to` URL is provided the user will be redirected to that URL after authorization. The `lud16`, `relay` and `pubkey` query parameters will be added to the URL.
- `expires_at` (optional) connection cannot be used after this date. Unix timestamp in seconds.
- `max_amount` (optional) maximum amount in sats that can be sent per renewal period
- `budget_renewal` (optional) reset the budget at the end of the given budget renewal. Can be `never` (default), `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`
- `request_methods` (optional) url encoded, space separated list of request types that you need permission for: `pay_invoice` (default), `get_balance` (see NIP47). For example: `..&request_methods=pay_invoice%20get_balance`

Example:

`/apps/new?name=myapp&pubkey=47c5a21...&return_to=https://example.com`

#### Web-flow: client created secret

Web clients can open a new prompt popup to load the authorization page.
Once the user has authorized the app connection a `nwc:success` message is sent to the opening page (using `postMessage`) to indicate that the connection is authorized. See the `initNWC()` function in the [alby-js-sdk](https://github.com/getAlby/alby-js-sdk#nostr-wallet-connect-documentation)

Example:

```js
import { webln } from "alby-js-sdk";
const nwc = new webln.NWC();
// initNWC opens a prompt with /apps/new?c=myapp&pubkey=xxxx
// the promise resolves once the user has authorized the connection (when the `nwc:success` message is received) and the popup is closed automatically
// the promise rejects if the user cancels by closing the prompt popup
await nwc.initNWC({ name: "myapp" });
```
